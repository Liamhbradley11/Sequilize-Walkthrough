# Sequelize-Walkthrough

 This application is a basic application where the user is prompted to a sign up form where they are given the option to either log in or sign up.  If the user already has an account they can opt for the log-in option and if they donâ€™t they can create one with an email and password.  Once the information is entered they then click sign up where they are sent to a welcome page that shows their email on the page and the option to log out.

  ## Getting Started
  After running npm install and installing everything you will then need to create a database.  Open mySQL workbench to host your queries.  You will create a new database, passport_demo.  Run, refresh and save.  You will then need to make sure that that your password is correct in the config.json.  This will allow it to connect to the database.  Run node server.js to open up the localhost with the port you chose to run it on.
